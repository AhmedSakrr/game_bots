# game_bots

This repo contains several game bots with the main purpose to help during gaming.
Some bots can be considered cheating so dont use these in public gaming or achive things you couldn't do yourself.
In these bots we usually use random delays to hide obvious patterns, but this can still easily be detected by anticheating programs.

## Crusaders of the lost idols
This is a self-playing bot written in python3. Just start the game on steam and then run the bot.
It uses gui functions like keypresses and mousecontroll, to controll the bot we use a keyboard hook.
Test the commands "esc" to exit program and "ctrl + k" to start autoclicks.

## Diablo 3
My first thought was, how would you play diablo3 if you only have one hand? Or if you don't have a mouse.
This bot works as a key pressing macro that auto activates abilities for you so that one hand
on the mouse is all that is needed. You need to use appropriate abilities and builds!
So just buy this game from blizzard and start it. Then activate the bot you need.
The result is a program that controll skills for you and let you controll the character with
the arrow buttons.

## Guild wars 2
Same as diablo 3 this bot helps with function activation. I also added a testing auto farm function.
Buy this game from Arenanet  and start it. Activate the bot with "ctrl + k",
exit with "esc".
