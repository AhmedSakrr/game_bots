# game_bots

This repo contains several game bots with the main purpose to help during gaming.
Some bots can be considered cheating so dont use these in public gaming or to achive things you couldn't do yourself.
In these bots we usually use random delays to hide obvious patterns, but this can still easily be detected by anticheating software.

## How to run the bots?
1. Install python3 and needed libraries.
2. Download or clone this repo
3. All files import the core_bot.py file
4. Start a bot
```
python auto_play.py
```

## Crusaders of the lost idols
This is a self-playing bot written in python3. Just start the game on steam and then run the bot.
It uses gui functions like keypresses and mousecontroll, to controll the bot we use a keyboard hook.
Test the commands "esc" to exit program and "ctrl + k" to start autoclicks. Bots developed for crusaders of the lost idols:
* auto_play - a bot that auto play this clicker game.

## Diablo 3
My first thought was, how would you play diablo3 if you only have one hand? Or if you don't have a mouse.
These bots include key pressing macro that auto activates abilities for you so that one hand
on the mouse is all that is needed. You need to use appropriate abilities and builds! If you dont have a mouse there is also a bot that lets you  controll the character with arrow buttons. So just buy this game from blizzard and start it.
Then activate the bot you need. Bots developed for diablo3 include:
* ability_bot - a bot that clicks ability buttons with modifiable cooldown.
* arrow_movement_controller - a bot that lets the user.
